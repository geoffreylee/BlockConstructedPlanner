	
Initializing a new draftbot plan:
Rules setup:
	Edit the plaintext files in the rules directory: 
	banlist.txt - input banned cards
	setlist.txt - the name of all the legal sets (full names or this will cause problems)
	and then the 3 official banlists from Wizards as they currently stand (in the obvious files)

	Run make_machine_list.py and put the names of all the lists we just input; they will be parsed into json

Generating database:
	Next, go to the data directory
	Run format.py on the spells and creatures txt files of each format
	Run formatlands.py on the lands txt files of ecah format

	return to the parent directory and run generatetoplegacydb.py and generatetopmoderndb.py
	run generate_relevance_data.py

Viewing the analyses:
	Go to the analyses folder and run parse_setscores DO NOT SKIP THIS SET OR THE DATABASE CAN HAVE INCONSISTENCIES
	Sorted.json for viewing

Generating the CardIndex:
	Populate the data/legacydecks and data/moderndecks with desired meta decks; primarily supports MTGGoldfish so make sure the lists are in that format; must be hand downloaded unfortunately bc they dont like giving deck info
	run build_decks_db.py
		- manually provide relative path to decks
	run build_card_index.py
		- if this takes over 10 minutes something may have lagged it out; cancel and try again
	run calculate_clump_intersections.py (recursion based with pruning - TODO: whats the runtime complexity O(f(x))


The project is fully ready for the next draft
	Main features are 
		- setclumpviewer.py (run first) 
		- parse_setscores.py (run second)
	Now we can freely use and reconfigure 
		- sequencer.py takes a decklist and sequences your picks
		- predict.py to predict other people's decks and generate data for the sets_visualizer


Using the GUI:
	Make sure you edit the me="Geoff" variable in sequence_visualizer/js/setup.js if you want to use someone else's perspective
